# DOE REGULATORY CHANGES: FAQs FOR POOL PROFESSIONALS

Q: WHEN DID THE NEW U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY (DOE) REGULATIONS GO INTO EFFECT?

A: The new DOE pool pump regulations went into effect on July 19, 2021. On and after this date, pump manufacturers can no longer produce non-compliant pumps for sale for use in the United States.

Q: CAN I SELL AND/OR INSTALL PUMPS MADE PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE?

A: Yes, the new DOE regulations only affect pool pump manufacturers. After the effective date (July 19, 2021), manufacturers can only manufacture pumps that meet the new energy-efficiency and labeling requirements. Pool builders, pool servicers and pool stores may still sell and install pumps manufactured prior to the effective date.

Q: WHAT ABOUT THE PUMPS I ALREADY HAVE IN STOCK?

A: You can continue to sell, install and maintain older pumps that you have in stock or as long as you can acquire inventory.

Q: WHAT ABOUT PUMPS I HAVE PREVIOUSLY INSTALLED OR SOLD?

A: Previously manufactured, sold or installed pumps are not subject to the new DOE regulations. Older model pumps can still be sold and installed—they just can’t be manufactured.

This is similar to the phasing out of incandescent light bulbs in the lighting industry. After the effective date, manufacturers were no longer able to produce incandescent light bulbs. However, stores that had incandescent bulbs stocked could still sell them.

Q: WHAT DO I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT WEF?

A: WEF stands for weighted energy factor and is a new standard for evaluating the energy efficiency of pool pumps. It was created as part of the broader set of DOE regulations. WEF is based on energy factors at different pump speeds (when applicable). It’s similar to miles per gallon (MPG) ratings for vehicles—the higher a pump's WEF rating, the more efficient the pump.

Because of the new DOE regulations, all pumps manufactured after July 19, 2021, are required to meet WEF energy-efficiency standards and be labeled with their WEF rating.

Pool pros should help consumers understand WEF ratings so they can make a more educated choice when purchasing a pool pump—ultimately helping them save energy and reduce their utility bills.

Q: WHICH POOL PUMPS HAVE THE BEST WEF RATINGS?

A: Hayward in-ground pumps have the highest (best) WEF ratings in the pool industry. You can visit the DOE website or ENERGY STAR website to compare the WEF ratings of different pump brands and models.

Q: WHICH POOL PUMP BRAND CARRIES THE BROADEST RANGE OF DOE-COMPLIANT PUMPS?

A: Hayward carries the broadest range of DOE-compliant pumps.

Q: WHAT ELSE DO I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE NEW DOE REGULATIONS?

While non-compliant pumps can no longer be manufactured as of July 19, 2021, there are already plenty of compliant models that ensure you can continue business as usual.

- All Hayward VS and XE ultra-high efficiency pumps are compliant
- Many Hayward high efficiency pumps are compliant:
- 1 HP and smaller Hayward Super Pump models
- 1 HP and smaller Hayward MaxFlo XL models
- Most above-ground pumps and cleaner booster pumps will remain single-speed

# Hydraulics

# THE BASICS OF PUMP/FILTER SIZING

Hydraulics is the study and understanding of the behavior of liquids at rest and in motion. We are concerned with water, and the following characteristics of our application:

1. How much water do we have (Pool Capacity)?
2. How fast can we safely move the water (Turnover Rate and Water Velocity)?
3. How much resistance will this water meet while moving through the system (Friction Loss)?
4. How will we overcome this resistance (Pump/Filter Sizing)?

Following are step-by-step instructions to answer these four questions and ultimately determine the proper size pump or filter for virtually any installation. Below each step is a calculation based on the following example: 16 ft by 32 ft rectangular pool, 3 ft to 8 ft deep, 2" suction side and return side plumbing. Existing 1 H.P. pump; filter gauge reads 10 PSI (clean).

# 1. Pool Capacity

To determine total gallons, we must first calculate the surface area of the pool in square feet:

Surface Area
16 ft x 32 ft = 512 ft2

Next, multiply the surface area by the average depth to determine the appropriate volume of the pool.

Average Depth
(3 ft + 8 ft) ÷ 2 = 5.5 ft

Volume = 512 ft2 x 5.5 ft = 2,816 ft3

Next, multiply the pool’s volume in ft3 by 7.5 to get the pool capacity in gallons:

Pool Capacity
2,816 ft3 x 7.5 gallons/ft3 = 21,120 gallons

Some of the more common pool sizes are:

|Above-Ground Size|Gallons*|
|---|---|
|15 ft Round|5,293|
|18 ft Round|7,622|
|21 ft Round|10,374|
|24 ft Round|13,550|
|12 ft x 24 ft Rectangle|8,626|
|27 ft Round|17,149|

*Average Depth: 4 ft

|In-Ground Size|Gallons*|
|---|---|
|12 ft x 24 ft Rectangle|11,861|
|16 ft x 32 ft Rectangle|21,086|
|18 ft x 36 ft Rectangle|26,687|
|20 ft x 40 ft Rectangle|32,947|

*Average Depth: 5.5 ft

# 2. Flow Rate

While the actual flow rate of a pump is based on the total resistance of the system as described below, the desired flow rate must be calculated to verify it will satisfy Turnover Rate and Water Velocity requirements.

# 2A. Turnover Rate

The turnover rate for a swimming pool is the amount of time required to circulate the entire volume of water through the system once to meet reasonably clean, safe water standards. Check with local regulations for the minimum required turnover rate.

Based on the pool’s capacity and the desired turnover rate, the minimum rate at which the water must be circulated in Gallons Per Minute (GPM) is calculated as follows:

|A. Minimum Flow in Gallons per Hour (GPH)|21,120 gallons ÷ 10 hours (assumed) = 2,112 gallons per hour|
|---|---|
|B. Minimum Flow in Gallons per Minute (GPM)|2,112 gallons per hour ÷ 60 minutes per hour = 35 gallons per minute|

# Pumps

# Hydraulics

# THE BASICS OF PUMP/FILTER SIZING

2B. Water Velocity

The maximum recommended water velocity is six (6) or eight (8) feet per second for suction lines and ten (10) feet per second for return lines. Check with local regulations for the maximum water velocity for suction and return lines. The table below lists the maximum flow in GPM based on plumbing size and water velocity.

|Pipe Size|6.0 ft/sec|8.0 ft/sec|10.0 ft/sec|
|---|---|---|---|
|1 1/2"|38 GPM|51 GPM|63 GPM|
|2"|63 GPM|84 GPM|105 GPM|
|2 1/2"|90 GPM|119 GPM|149 GPM|
|3"|138 GPM|184 GPM|230 GPM|

Maximum Flow: 2" suction side plumbing at 6.0 ft/sec = 63 gallons per minute

2C. Desired Flow

The desired flow rate must be between the minimum flow based on the Turnover Rate and the maximum flow based on the Water Velocity. Note that if higher flow rates are needed, such as for water features, the maximum possible flow would have to be increased by using larger size plumbing (e.g. increase from 2" to 2 ½" plumbing). The use of branch (parallel) plumbing can also be used to reduce the flow and therefore plumbing size. Check with local regulations for proper plumbing sizing.

Minimum Flow (Turnover Rate): 35 GPM

Maximum Flow (Water Velocity): 63 GPM

Desired Flow: 50 GPM

3. Friction Loss (Head Loss)

Everything that the water must pass through within the circulation system — plumbing and equipment — creates resistance or Friction Loss (also referred to as Head Loss). The friction loss for standard plumbing supplies such as pipe, elbows, fittings, etc. can be found using published reference tables. Friction loss for equipment such as filters, heaters, and chlorination systems can be found in charts and/or curves provided by the manufacturer. The sum of all the resistance is called Total Dynamic Head (TDH) and is typically measured in Feet of Water or Feet of Head.

A properly sized pump will have the ability to overcome the Total Dynamic Head of the system while, at the same time, providing flow that will satisfy Turnover Rate and Water Velocity requirements.

For new installations, it is possible to calculate TDH by using reference tables and manufacturer's data to determine the friction loss associated with every component in the circulation system.

For existing installations, we are often unable to determine the total amount of pipe and fittings . . . it's underground. Therefore, what follows is a simplified "rule-of-thumb" means of determining Total Dynamic Head.

Pumps Existing Installations

For existing installations, use the Total Dynamic Head calculated from the Friction Loss on the Vacuum and Pressure side of the pump.

Total Dynamic Head = ____________ ft of water

Using the manufacturer’s performance curve for the existing pump, find the flow that corresponds to the Total Dynamic Head. This is the actual flow at which the pump is currently operating, which may or may not meet Turnover Rate and Water Velocity requirements.

Verify the actual flow rate is between the minimum flow based on the Turnover Rate and the maximum flow based on the Water Velocity.

THE BASICS OF PUMP/FILTER SIZING

Friction Loss

The point where the performance curve for a particular pump intersects the system curve determines the flow and Total Dynamic Head where that pump will operate.

Filter Sizing

A filter, be it DE, sand, or cartridge, has a Design Flow Rate in GPM as well as a Turnover Capacity in Gallons. See the table below for example. The specific performance data for Hayward® filters is provided in the Filter Section of this Buyer’s Guide.

|Model Number|Filtration Rate Area|Design Flow|Turnover Capacity (Gallons)|
|---|---|---|---|
|S180T|1.75 ft2|35 GPM|16,800 (8 Hours) / 21,000 (10 Hours)|
|S210T|2.20 ft2|44 GPM|21,120 (8 Hours) / 26,400 (10 Hours)|
|S220T/T2|2.64 ft2|52 GPM|24,960 (8 Hours) / 31,200 (10 Hours)|
|S244T/T2|3.14 ft2|62 GPM|29,760 (8 Hours) / 37,200 (10 Hours)|
|S270T/T2|3.70 ft2|74 GPM|35,520 (8 Hours) / 44,400 (10 Hours)|
|S310T2|4.91 ft2|98 GPM|47,040 (8 Hours) / 58,800 (10 Hours)|
|S360SX|6.50 ft2|130 GPM|62,400 (8 Hours) / 78,000 (10 Hours)|

In this example, the flow for the 3/4 H.P. pump is between the minimum and maximum flow and is therefore properly sized for the application.

Saving Money by Saving Energy

Depending upon utility rates, pool characteristics, and equipment selected, the energy and dollar savings from an energy efficient single, two, or variable speed pump compared to a standard single speed pump can be quite significant.

For example, a system featuring an energy efficient high performance pump drawing 5.34 amps at 230 volts where the local utility rate is $0.12 per kWh will cost you approximately $1.78 over a 12 hour period per day. A standard pump drawing 7.0 amps will cost you approximately $2.32 per day or an extra $197 annually!

Use this worksheet to help determine your energy savings:

|A. Motor Amp Rating|B. Voltage (e.g. 115 volts or 230 volts)|C. Local Energy Rate ($ per kWh)*|D. Approximate Power Usage (Watts) = A x B**|E. Kilowatts = D / 1000|F. $ per hour = E x C|G. Hours of Operation|H. Cost per Day = F x G|J. Monthly Cost = H x 30|K. Yearly Cost = H x number of months pool is in operation|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | | | | | | |

NOTES: *Refer to your utility bill to determine local rate **Estimated. It is recommended to use a wattmeter to determine the actual power consumption.

# THREE METHODS OF FILTRATION

Filtration

The importance of proper swimming pool or spa filtration can not be overstated. The reasons for filtration are obvious — clear water not only looks beautiful, but it is also necessary for health and safety reasons. Much of the material suspended in the water, derived from plant and animal sources, provides food for bacteria and algae. It is these materials that must be removed if a pool or spa is to be maintained in a safe and sanitary condition.

The three most popular types of filtration currently in use in residential pools and spas are high-rate sand, cartridge, and diatomaceous earth (D.E.). Each method of filtration is explained below.

# High-Rate Sand

The oldest and most popular method of filtration is sand. Sand filters share two things in common: 1) When in the filtration mode, water always flows from top to bottom; 2) They all have some sort of lateral or underdrain with slots to hold back sand while allowing clean, filtered water to pass through.

High-rate sand filters use a special filter sand, normally .45 to .55 mm (also known as pool-grade #20 silica sand), because it has sharp edges that serve to separate particles, allowing filtration to take place. They operate on the basis of “depth” filtration; dirt is driven through the sand bed and trapped in the minute spaces between the particles of sand. Initially, a clean sand bed will remove larger particles, and then, as the bed starts to load up, it will remove finer particles.

Cleaning of the media, or sand bed, is accomplished through reversing the flow through the filter, to the “waste” line. This is known as backwashing.

# Cartridge

Cartridge filtration has been available for a relatively long time, but only recently has it begun to enjoy rapid growth and acceptance. When water passes through a cartridge filter, dirt is screened out at the surface of the cartridge element. When clean, the element will trap larger particles, with finer particles being filtered out as the pores of the element become clogged by the larger debris.

# Diatomaceous Earth (D.E.)

Many pool professionals consider D.E. filtration to be the finest because it is capable of removing smaller particles than either sand or cartridge. Diatomaceous earth is a porous powder with microscopic openings that, when magnified, look like tiny sponges. Clear water can pass through these openings, but particles, as small as five microns, are trapped the first pass through the media. All D.E. filters have internal elements that become coated with D.E. It is this “filter cake” that strains dirt, dust, algae, and some forms of bacteria from the water.

# Technical Data – Filtration

|Filtration Method|Suggested Filtration Rate (GPM/ft.2)|Approximate Filtration Range (Microns)|
|---|---|---|
|High-Rate Sand|20 (Residential), 20 (Commercial)|20 to 40|
|Cartridge|1* (Residential), .375 (Commercial)|10 to 20|
|Diatomaceous Earth|2.5 (Residential), 2 (Commercial)|5|

NOTE: *Use Commercial Filtration Rate (.375 GPM/ft2) to meet APSP-15

# Heater Selection Guide

# SELECTING THE CORRECT SIZE HEATER FOR POOLS & SPAS

|Pool Sizing|Spa/Hot Tub Sizing|
|---|---|
|Determine your pool’s surface area in square feet: Locate in the desired table below, the surface area equal to or just greater than the pool’s surface area, read to the left and select the appropriate heater. For indoor pool installations divide the pool’s surface area by 3. Tables are based on a 30˚F temperature rise, 3 1⁄2 MPH average wind velocity and elevation of up to 2,000 feet above sea level.|Determine your spa capacity in gallons (Surface area x average depth x 7 1⁄2). The reference tables list the time required in minutes to raise the temperature of the spa/hot tub by 30˚F. Locate in the desired table below the spa/hot tub size in gallons equal to or just greater than the spa/hot tub size in gallons. Select the desired time to raise the spa/hot tub temperature 30˚F, read to the left and select the appropriate heater. This guide can be adjusted for other temperature rises. For example, if you desire a 15˚F increase in temperature, simply divide the time for 30˚F rise by the ratio of 30/15 = 2. Note: Heat losses and/or heat absorbed by spa walls or other objects will add to heat-up time. Spa sizing is based on an insulated and covered spa. Always cover your spa or hot tub when not in use to minimize heat loss and evaporation.|

# AUTOMATIC CLEANER HOSE SELECTION AND SIZING GUIDE

Sizing Automatic Cleaner Hose Length/Tips on Vacuum Requirements

To correctly size Hayward automatic cleaners, measure from the skimmer or Vac Lock to the farthest point in the pool. Add two hose lengths to provide sufficient mobility for the cleaner.

Example: A 16' x 32' rectangular pool will normally require 8-10 lengths of hose depending on depth and skimmer placement.

After the correct hose length is selected and automatic cleaner installed, use the in-line vacuum gauge to check for proper water flow and adjust to satisfy the formula below.

Proper Vacuum = 1" of vacuum x # of hose lengths

Example: A pool using 8 hose lengths requires 8" of vacuum for proper operation.

If the vacuum level is too high, adjust the filter system valving accordingly. In the absence of sufficient valving, use the optional in-line regulator valve.

Improper vacuum levels can prevent the cleaner from climbing vertical walls in gunite/concrete pools or “sticking” at steps and corners. Maintaining proper vacuum also ensures efficient water flow through the throat for effective cleaning.

For complete installation information, refer to your Hayward automatic pool cleaner’s installation manual.

The use of non-Hayward hoses is not recommended as it can greatly reduce the cleaner coverage, wall climbing capability, and cleaning performance.

The ClearO 3 water purifying system is the perfect addition to any new or existing pool for the cleanest water possible. Ozone actively breaks down non-living waste products in pool water which can combine with chlorine to form unhealthy by-products that can cause eye and skin irritation. The ClearO 3 creates ozone using a proprietary UV bulb designed to create ozone molecules from the oxygen in the air. This ozone is delivered into the pool water using the unit’s suction injection system, where the ozone enriched air is mixed with the water going into the pool circulation pump. This creates a dynamic environment that best mixes the ozone and water.

# Applications

- For all residential pools, new or existing
- Single unit effective for up to 55,000 gallons

# Features

- Cleanest, strongest non-chlorine shock available with oxygen being its only by-product

# FOR SALT CHLORINE GENERATORS Salt Facts

Hayward Salt Chlorine Generators all produce their own chlorine from a low concentration of salt dissolved into the pool water to create 100% of the pool’s sanitizing needs.

Will the pool water taste salty?

No. The concentration of salt in the pool water is approximately 1/10 of the level in the ocean and is below the level of taste for most people. This level of salt is equivalent to 1 teaspoon of salt in a gallon of water.

Types of salt

Salt chlorine generators use ordinary food grade, solar salt or water softener salt. Regardless of which type of salt you chose ensure that it is at least 99% pure salt (NaCl). Never use rock salt (ice melt) or salts that have more than 1% of “anti-caking agents”, “yellow prussiate of soda”, or “sodium ferrocyanide” added as these compounds may cause staining of the pool. Salt is available from most distributors in 40-80 pound bags.

Amount of salt to add to the pool

Hayward salt chlorine generation systems require salt levels between 2700 and 3400 ppm. Note: Refer to individual Hayward model capabilities to operate at lower levels, covering a wider salt range of 800-8000 ppm. This amount of salt is below the level of taste for most people and is the equivalent of 1 teaspoon of salt per gallon. Since all

Sanitization

The salt display responds slowly to rapid changes in salt level. It takes up to 24 hours of circulation for the salt to be evenly distributed in the pool. Be patient and do not over-react by adding too much salt. If the salt level is still low after 24-48 hours, add the reserve bags (see “How to add salt” above) to the pool.

Pool Chemistry

POOL CHEMISTRY FOR SALT CHLORINE GENERATORS

It is important to maintain salt and stabilizer levels in order to prevent scaling and to maximize system effectiveness. Test the water periodically and use standard pool industry procedures to adjust levels.

Salt
2700 to 3400 ppm

Check monthly using an independent salt test. The higher end of the salt level range lets the salt chlorine generator produce more chlorine. The salt chlorine generator will indicate when the salt level drops below 2700 ppm and it will stop operating if the salt drops to 2300 ppm or below.* The alarms/indicators for the AQR S3 are configurable and the high/low alarms can be set to any value between 1200–8000 ppm, and the system will shut off at 800 ppm and 8000 ppm. On most pools, the salt level tends to slowly drift downward as fresh water is added to the pool (rain or makeup water for splash-out, back-washing etc.). A good procedure is to add enough salt to be near the top of the range. Add stabilizer (see below) at the same time. Although 2700–3400 ppm is the desired range, AquaRite S3 Salt Chlorination System operates over a broad range of salt levels, 800–8000 ppm.

Stabilizer
30 to 50 ppm

Check monthly. Stabilizer is also known as conditioner, cyanuric acid, or isocyanuric acid. Refer to local codes regarding its use. Stabilizer helps maintain the chlorine residual in the pool by protecting it from the UV rays of the sun. Without stabilizer, the salt chlorine generator would have to produce much more chlorine in order to keep the desired residual level in the pool. This can reduce the life of the cell. Add enough stabilizer to be near the top end of the range at the same time you add salt.

Chlorine

Ideally, all of the chlorine in the pool should be “free chlorine” and there should be zero ”combined chlorine.” “Free chlorine” means that it is not attached to any contaminants in the pool and is ready to attack any algae or bacteria that it comes in contact with. Note that test kits using the OTO method (yellow color) only test total chlorine and can not differentiate between “free” and “combined”. DPD test kits (red color) do allow for the testing of both total chlorine and “free chlorine”.

pH determines Chlorine effectiveness

The recommended pH range is 7.2 to 7.8. If the pool’s pH rises above the top end of the range, the sanitizing effectiveness of the chlorine can be greatly reduced. For example: The chlorine in a pool with the pH at 7.2 is approximately ten times more effective than the same amount of chlorine in a pool with the pH at 8.2.

Why is water chemistry important?

Continuous filtration, cleaning and sanitization are not enough — balancing pH (potential hydrogen) is vital. Chlorination should keep germs and algae at bay but when pH is unbalanced, it can’t do its job. Let the pH drop too low and the water becomes acidic and attacks anything it touches. When pH drifts up, the water becomes alkaline

NOTE: *Refer to individual Hayward model capabilities to operate at lower levels, covering a wider salt range of 800–8000 ppm.

|WATER QUALITY PARAMETER|IDEAL LEVELS|
|---|---|
|Salt|2700 to 3400 ppm|
|Free Chlorine|1.0 to 3.0 ppm|
|pH|7.2 to 7.8|
|Cyanuric Acid (Stabilizer)|30 to 50 ppm*|
|Total Alkalinity|80 to 120 ppm|
|Calcium Hardness|200 to 400 ppm|
|Metals|0 ppm|
|Saturation Index|–0.2 to 0.2 (optimal)|

NOTE: *Should be lower or even 0 for indoor pools. Follow guidance of a local pool professional.

NOTES: *New 120V lights are only UL listed when installed with a Hayward niche. SP0570 Series lights are direct replacements for older SP0540 and SP0560 Series lights. As of 2004, niches 600 will not accept 570 lights because there is no place for the lower shoulder screw. If a new niche is needed, replace niche and light fixture using the 580 Series lights.

Suction Outlets

SQUARE DRAIN COVERS AND FRAMES

For residential and commercial concrete pools, Hayward square drain covers are available in a wide range of sizes and flow designs to satisfy any installation requirement. Whether the application demands frames and covers for new construction or replacement cover assemblies for existing installations, Hayward suction outlets set the standard for quality and value. Hayward’s High Flow covers have some of the industry’s highest approved flow rates. Each size and flow design cover retrofit to existing Hayward frames and are designed for an extensive 7 year life span. All Hayward WG Series suction outlet fitting assemblies and replacement covers have been tested to ANSI/APSP/ICC-16 2017, are VGB compliant and meet CPSP requirements.

Installation of anything other than the recommended Hayward drain cover on a Hayward frame or Hayward sump may not be ANSI/APSP/ICC-16 2017 compliant. Likewise, the installation of a Hayward drain cover on a non-Hayward frame may not be compliant.

Applications

- Meets various flow category requirements
- Installations in concrete, residential and commercial pools

# Venturi Skimmers

PARASKIMV VENTURI SKIMMER FOR IN-GROUND CONCRETE OR GUNITE POOLS AND SPAS

The Paramount ParaskimV venturi skimmer offers high-performing features no other venturi skimmer can match, paired with an energy saving design. ParaskimV works brilliantly with multi-speed pumps without sacrificing a cleaner pool. In fact, ParaskimV can generate the same skimming action just as effectively at a pump’s slower speeds, so you can take full advantage of the energy savings available with a multi-speed pump. ParaskimV can even enhance the skimming action when using a single speed pool pump by combining the venturi effect with the standard skimmer operation.

# Paramount Venturi Skimmers

Since ParaskimV can effectively remove debris from the surface at lower pump speeds, you can direct 100% suction to the main drain of the pool, maximizing its ability to remove heavier settled debris.

# PARALEVEL FOR IN-GROUND POOLS AND SPAS

Paramount’s innovative water leveler, Paralevel, was designed from a pool builders perspective with builders, homeowners and service technicians in mind. No components of this unit were adapted from other industries. Paralevel is continually working behind the scenes to ensure that your pool or spa is at its ideal level. You can rest easy knowing that your pool’s water level is being monitored and adjusted automatically. If you ever need to make a manual adjustment Paralevel’s “posi-click” adjustment makes it easy. One full turn equals ¼" (6 mm) of water level adjustment.

Unlike other water levelers Paralevel offers “Smart-Sensing”, which means it will ignore water sloshing in the pool as it only senses the pool's true level. “Smart-Sensing” also protects Paralevel so it will not cycle on and off rapidly, like other levelers. This limits the potential for premature failure, and eliminates loud water hammer in your home that could lead to damage to your plumbing.

Applications:

- In-ground pools and spas

Features:

- Simple to set, use and winterize
- Easy, accurate “Posi-Click” adjustment
- Smaller footprint in your pool deck
- “Smart-Sensing” not affected by water splashing
- Large balance line
- Overflow line ready
- Quick fill capable
- Service industry friendly

DECK-SIDE AND EQUIPMENT-SIDE DEBRIS CANISTERS

The Paramount Deck-side Debris Containment Canister (DDC2) minimizes the time spent maintaining your swimming pool. The DDC2 is conveniently located in the pool deck for easy debris removal. The large capacity basket collects debris before it reaches the pump basket allowing the pump to run more efficiently and with less chance of clogging — utilizing the included fine mesh bag filters out even smaller debris.

The Paramount Equipment Debris Canister (EDC) is a highly effective, efficient, easy to install equipment-side debris canister for all pools. It’s plumbed before the circulation pump to trap debris from spa, skimmer and main drain lines before it reaches the pump and filter. The basket holds up to 68% more debris than any other equipment side canister, and utilizing the included fine mesh bag filters out even smaller debris. Its high efficiency design ensures maximum water flow with minimal restriction.

# OPEN LINE SELECTAFLO HIGH-EFFICIENCY, MULTIPORT, AND SLIDE VALVES FOR D.E. FILTERS Valves

SelectaFlo high–efficiency backwash valves are hydro–engineered to provide superior flow at lower pressure drops. They feature an easy–to–use trigger action handle that lets you select from four valve/filter functions: filter, backwash, pump to waste or recirculate. SelectaFlo valves are ideal for D.E. filter applications requiring high efficiency and low head loss.

# Control Valve Functions

- FILTER – For normal filtering and regular vacuuming.
- BACKWASH – For purging filter of accumulated debris.
- WASTE – Bypasses the filter for draining or lowering pool water level and for vacuuming heavy debris directly to waste line.
- RECIRCULATE – Water is recirculated through the SP0425 designed to fit Hayward ® ProGrid and DEP 500 Series D.E. Filters valve, bypassing the filter.

# Features

- Rugged ergonomic handle allows for easy selection of four positions: filter, backwash, pump to waste or recirculate
- EcoFlo fitting (included with valve) allows for simple and efficient plumbing to TriStar ™ pumps
- Built–in sight glass provides convenient backwash viewing
- Innovative lock ring and seal carrier minimize service time
- Versatile ports accept 2" (SKT) or 2.5" (Spig) pipe for easy installation

NOTES: *For pumps with an “SP1600X–” part number (manufactured before 1983), the use of these new kits (SPX2600CKIT – SPX2615CKIT) will upgrade the old pump to our current “SP2600X–” series. This will improve flow, reduce noise and provide slightly better energy efficiencies. All individual components included in the kits are not available. Replacement dedicated-purpose pool pump motors that are single-phase and 0.5 Total HP or greater but not variable speed cannot be offered for final retail sale in California per Title 20 CCR Section 1601-1609 or New York State per Title 21 Section 509.

# COMMERCIAL SANITIZATION WATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS

# Commercial Sanitization

With our sanitization solutions, commercial pools and spas benefit from the clearest, safest water possible. Our Saline C® Series salt chlorine generators meet commercial demands while delivering the same natural comforts of salt chlorination so common in the residential market. Our HydroRite UV ultraviolet secondary disinfection system is the only low-pressure UV system NSF-certified to kill 99.9%* of Cryptosporidium and other chlorine-resistant microorganisms, while reducing skin-irritating chloramines. Plus, you can pair our salt chlorinators and secondary disinfection systems with CAT Controllers® for a completely automated sanitization solution.

# HYDRORITE® UV COMMERCIAL ULTRAVIOLET SECONDARY AND SUPPLEMENTAL SYSTEMS

ELIMINATE 99.9%* OF PATHOGENS FOR 100% PEACE OF MIND. HydroRite UV from Hayward® Commercial Aquatics isn't just our most user-friendly sanitization system ever—it's also the most sophisticated pool sanitization product available. As the only low-pressure UV system certified by the NSF to destroy 99.9%* of Cryptosporidium (a leading cause of Recreational Water Illness) and other chlorine-resistant microorganisms, HyrdoRite UV utilizes two separate ultraviolet wavelengths to create ozone and powerful germ-destroying hydroxyl radicals. And because it reduces demand for both energy and chloramine-producing chemicals, HydroRite UV is definitive solution for greater savings and the greatest swimmer comfort possible.

NSF LISTED C US WARRANTY

LOW-RISK INVESTMENT FOR HIGH-RISK ENVIRONMENTS.

- Kills 99.9% of Cryptosporidium using dual-wavelength (185/254 nm) UV to produce ozone and hydroxyl radicals
- Supplemental and/or secondary disinfection as recommended by the CDC Model Aquatic Health Code (MAHC)
- Reduces irritating chloramines 50% or more, improving indoor air quality and swimmer comfort
- Reduces chemical demand 50% or more, lowering operating costs and extending salt cell life
- Low-pressure UV bulbs provide sterilization and oxidation with little or no impact on chlorine level
- Lightweight construction uses Schedule 80 PVC and 316L stainless steel for simple installation and maintenance
- Intuitive, plug-and-play design is easy to navigate and conserves energy with 120V power input
- Extended lamp life rated for 13,000 hours, more than double the time for comparable medium-pressure systems
- NSF 50 tested & certified to EPA standard from cryptosporidium removal

*HydroRite UV Secondary Disinfection Systems are certified to achieve a minimum inactivation equivalent of 3 log (99.9%) Cryptosporidium Parvum in accordance with NSF 50 and the US EPA UV DGM.

# WATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS COMMERCIAL SANITIZATION

STAY ON THE SAFEST SIDE OF SANITIZATION High bather loads create higher bacteria levels—most left untreated by chlorine alone. As a proactive measure, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control has created the MAHC, which highly recommends the use of UV or Ozone as a supplemental disinfectant treatment in every commercial pool. Hayward’s HydroRite UV ensures that commercial facilities stay on the cutting-edge of swimmer safety by using 3-log reduction—a standard set by the EPA—to reduce RWIs caused by Cryptosporidium and other harmful chlorine-resistant microorganisms. INSIDE THE VESSEL—BEHIND THE SCENES.

1. Dual-wavelength amalgam lamps produce both ozone and germicidal UV.
2. The ozone-treated water is exposed to ultraviolet rays that inactivate algae, bacteria, and viruses.
3. The germicidal UV interacts with the ozone to create hydroxyl free radicals (which have more oxidation potential than ozone) in a process known as Advanced Oxidation Process (AOP).

# MINIMUM ILLUMINANCE

Depending on the local health code, incandescent lights were historically required to provide 0.5 or 1 watt per square foot of pool surface area.

Today, most health departments and the Model Aquatic Health Code suggest 8-9 lumens per square foot.

This value only applies to lights using a white wavelength.

# LIGHTING PLACEMENT

Beam pattern: The angular spread of light emitted from the fixture.

The beam pattern is measured between points on opposite sides of the beam axis where the intensity drops to 50% of maximum power.

X-axis: Horizontal spread

Y-axis: Vertical spread
